[question-about-scoring-for-solo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2874409/question-about-scoring-for-solo)
> In solo mode, you're trying to beat the total of the dice on the round card. But each round, unless you use a tool, you'll be putting two dice on the card. Does this mean you're going to be totaling 15-19 dice (depending on how many tools you use)?

Yes. Your challenge is to choose dice that is both good for you and low for round track each round, and using tools for reduce total dice in round track too.

> The game has a tool card that says "Move any one die in your window ignoring color restrictions" with a picture of a red die placed in a blue space." my question is: can we use this card for place a die adjacent to a die of the same color too?

The tool Card is intended to be used so you can cover a colour on your board with a different coloured die. However, it also states that you can never break the adjacency rules. Never.
  
[running-pliers-and-tap-wheel-explained-plz](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2867007/running-pliers-and-tap-wheel-explained-plz)

> In solo mode what does the Running Pliers tool card mean? What is my first turn?

Your "first turn" is the first die that you draft in a round. The Running Pliers allow you to take both of your dice consecutively with no other players choosing in between.

> In solo mode what does that Tap Wheel tool card mean? How do you pick the color of the die on the round track? Are you able to pick any color on the round track?

Whatever color that you like on the round track, so long as you have two dice of that color in your window that can be legally swapped.

> When playing solo are you allowed to take 2 turns and also use a tool card or is it 1 turn and 1 tool.

It's actually up to two tools and up to two dice, divided into two sections. On your first turn of the round, you may take one die, and you may use one tool - both are optional, not mandatory. Then, on your second turn, you may do the same again. The Running Pliers would be an exception to this as you only take one turn in the round - you take one die (optional, although why you would not is unclear) and then you use a tool (the Pliers) to take another die. You do not get another turn that round so you could not use another tool.

> When playing solo are there any times you will not add any dice to the round track?

No, because the turn track is the timer for the end of the game.
  
[question-about-running-pliers](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2089185/question-about-running-pliers)

> The Running Pliers card reads After your first turn, immediately draft a die. Skip your next turn this round." It sound like you get to draft a place a second die right away, but lose your next turn.
> When you draft and place the second die, can you also play a second tool if you wanted to?

Basically you get to draft both your dice for the round right away. This could be helpful, for instance, towards the end of the game when you are running out of placements on your player board, and two dice come up that you can use, and you don't want other players to snatch up the second one before your second draft that round.
You draft your first die, use the tool to draft your second die, then everyone else goes. When it gets back to you that round you do nothing, since you have already drafted both dice that round.

[initial-dice-placement-are-the-topsbottoms-also-ed](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1765937/initial-dice-placement-are-the-topsbottoms-also-ed)

> The rules state that the first dice must be placed on an edge or a corner. Does this mean that the middle three slots on the top/bottom rows cannot be initial dice placement spots? In other words, are the "roof" and "floor" of the future window are not considered edges?

There are 4 edges to the window, any of them are valid for the first die placed. There's no distinction between side-edges or top/bottom edges.

The corners are mentioned to help clarify that they are valid (since playtesting revealed a few questions about corners specifically).

[rule-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2086608/rule-clarification)

> This question is in regard to the last die, or any undrafted dice. Besides keeping track of the round number, is there anything productive you can use those dice for?

Yes, there's a tool that lets you exchange you drafted die with one of the unchosen ones, pretty handy towards the end when you are the last player and you are left with no useful options top choose from.

But in the solo mode, you add the pips from all the dice on the round marker board to set the target score you're trying to beat each game, so you also have to think carefully about which dice you're NOT choosing each round.

[solo-mode-and-private-objectives](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2579945/solo-mode-and-private-objectives)

> In solo mode you get two Private Objectives face up and you get to score one of them. Don't you also still get one Private Objective face down that you score?

In Solo mode section from rulebook: End game scoring - Tally your Victory Point total as normal (selecting only one of the
two Private Objectives), however, you lose 3 Victory Points for
each open space.

It says about only two private objectives. You don't get a face down like a multiplayer game. This is one of the small changes from normal setup.

[what-happens-when-you-have-multiple-dice-at-end-of](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3296366/what-happens-when-you-have-multiple-dice-at-end-of)

> The rules say "At the end of the round each player should likely have taken 2 dice (unless they chose to pass).
> Any dice that are left over (usually only 1) are placed on the round Track, covering the number for the just completed round."
> What happens when you have multiple dice left over? (This also applies to the solo variant, where you roll four dice and may only use two.)

The rulebook under end of round says "all remaining dice are placed on the Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces."

> Is there an advantage to choosing a more difficult tile? If you use up all your tokens, do you get more points for doing the harder tile?

No. Each favor token is worth a point at the end of the game, so if you don’t end up spending any, you will get points. But the card itself doesn’t give you any points.

[2-player-drafting](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1786148/2-player-drafting)

> In a 2 player game should it be player 1 drafts, then player 2 drafts twice then player 1 drafts?


Yes, that's the correct order.
From the rulebook: "Once the last player has completed their first turn, the round continues in reverse order (counter-clockwise). Beginning with the last player, each player takes a second turn."

> If you use tools like Eglomise Brush to move a die ignoring a restriction (like color restriction), do you have to move the die to a spot that has a different color or can you move it on a white spot too?

If this tool ignore color restriction, yes you can move to any color space including white ones. But note that tools restrictions (color or number) only refers to your window pattern, not adjacent dice.
