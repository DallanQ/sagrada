[question-about-scoring-for-solo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2874409/question-about-scoring-for-solo)

> In solo mode, you're trying to beat the total of the dice on the round card. But each round, unless you use a tool, you'll be putting two dice on the card. Does this mean you're going to be totaling 15-19 dice (depending on how many tools you use)?

Yes. Your challenge is to choose dice that is both good for you and low for round track each round, and using tools for reduce total dice in round track too.

----
page 4

When playing Sagrada by yourself, you're trying to beat a Target Score. The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice on the Round Track at the end of the game.

----
page 4

Each game is played as normal in 10 rounds, with a few small changes:

Each round, pull 4 dice from the Dice Bag and roll them.
Take 2 turns, choosing to draft and place a die (as normal) and/or use a Tool Card, or pass.

----
page 4 

All remaining dice are placed on the Round Track as normal, taking care to not change the value of any dice. If no dice remain, use a Score Marker as a placeholder.

----
page 4

The game ends after the end of 10th round. Before flipping the Round Track, add up the Target Score.

The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice on the Round Track. Dice used to pay for Tool Cards are not counted.
Tally your Victory Point total as normal (selecting only one of the two Private Objectives), however, you lose 3 Victory Points for each open space.
If your Victory Point total is greater than the Target Score, you win!

It's actually up to two tools and up to two dice, divided into two sections. On your first turn of the round, you may take one die, and you may use one tool - both are optional, not mandatory. Then, on your second turn, you may do the same again.

> It sound like you get to draft and place a second die right away, but lose your next turn.
> When you draft and place the second die, can you also play a second tool if you wanted to?

Basically you get to draft both your dice for the round right away. This could be helpful, for instance, towards the end of the game when you are running out of placements on your player board, and two dice come up that you can use, and you don't want other players to snatch up the second one before your second draft that round.
You draft your first die, use the tool to draft your second die, then everyone else goes. When it gets back to you that round you do nothing, since you have already drafted both dice that round.

----
page 3

Beginning with the Start Player, each player takes a turn in clockwise order. On a player's turn, they may perform each of the following actions in any order:

Select 1 die from the Draft Pool and place it in an open space on their Window. This is referred to as Drafting a Die.
Use 1 Tool Card by spending Favor Tokens.
Each action is optional — A player may choose to perform both actions, only one action or pass their turn taking no actions.

Turns proceed clockwise with each player taking a turn or passing. Example - Emily takes a turn (1), then Ben (2), then Mari (3)

Once the last player has completed their first turn, the round continues in reverse order (counter- clockwise). Beginning with the last player, each player takes a second turn (selecting a second die from the Draft Pool, etc.) Example - Mari takes her second turn (4), then Ben (5), then Emily (6)

Once the Start Player has taken their second turn, proceed to the END OF THE ROUND.

There are 4 edges to the window, any of them are valid for the first die placed. There's no distinction between side-edges or top/bottom edges.

The corners are mentioned to help clarify that they are valid (since playtesting revealed a few questions about corners specifically).

[a-couple-of-specific-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2189133/a-couple-of-specific-questions)

> Tool Card #11 Flux Remover: When you pull a die from the bag, is it a random color or chosen color? Also, must the die be placed in the same window slot as the die you originally drafted?

When using Flux remover, you don't place the die at all, you just put it in the bag and take one out. You don't get to choose the color of the new die - you're stuck with whatever it is.
So pulling a die doesn't mean you get to choose the die. Drafting a die only means selecting from the pool, so there is no "same slot" to put it in.

> Public Objective - Color Diagonals: Are the dice counted in pairs or collectively? And can you count a die again if it's diagonal to multiple dice? For example, the picture on the card shows 4 blue dice, and 3 yellow dice. Would that be 3, 5, or 8 points? Or, if I had a X shape, would that be 1, 4, or 5 points?

You count every die that is diagonally adjacent to another of the same color collectively, so you would get 4+3=7 points for the configuration shown on the card. An X shape would be 5 points.
And if a die is adjacent diagonally to any other same colored die, count it as 1 point, otherwise, zero points. You can have a maximum of 20, because each die counts only once.

[problem-with-placing-dices](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3020005/problem-with-placing-dices)

> Concerning placing dice, for example when there are 2 players, often only one dice would be left at the end of the turn - so it goes on the round track. But what if there are two left? Should the dice placed on the track be chosen randomly? Because there are two tools that are connected to those dices. One that allows you to move dice of the same colour as the one on the track (which one of multiple left from last round should count?) and the other which lets you take any dice from the track.

From page 4 of the rulebook: It state that "all remaining dice are placed on the Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces."
Normally, you should only have one die left after everyone has taken their turn regardless of the player count. The only reason you would have more is that, if a player, for any or some reason was unable to place a die/dice. As noted above, all remaining dice go onto the round track. Just put the extra(s) above or below the normal one for the round. For the purpose of tools, all of the dice on the round track would count.

> How about the solo variant? Will all unused dices from each turn counts to the points you have to beat? (Which means at least 20 various dice?) - Is it even possible to win?

From page 4 of the rulebook: It state that "all remaining dice are placed on the Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces."
All of the unplayed dice count. And if player have been unable to play an additional 10 dice then the player will likely lose.
And yes, player have to play against at least 20 dice. As sometimes it can be brutal.

[round-track-match](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2718459/round-track-match)

> Two players were in a situation where both of them could not draft in the second draft round. In other words, there were three dice in the drafting pool where we were not able to draft at all. So while paying attention not to cover extra rounds, we would normally move all these three dice to the round track. We had the public mission "Round Track Match," which gives three points for each dice in your window that matches those on the round track. As the first player, should I be the one who chooses which of the remaining die should be placed on the round spot, while my partner argued I could not as it would be another form of drafting in a situation where I cannot draft.
Rulebook explains the procedure as follows: All remaining dice are placed on Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces.
As seen above, there is no explicit statement whether the first player of the round chooses the die that covers the spot of the just-completed round. So we were wondering what the official solution for this case is.

Yes, all unused dice are placed on the round track, and there is no restriction on which dice are placed there. In the case where both players cannot draft dice in a round, all remaining dice in the draft pool are moved to the round track, covering the spot for the just-completed round. You do not need to select just one die to place; all dice that could not be drafted will cover the round spot.

The *Round Track Match* public objective gives points for each die on your window that matches a die placed on the round track. Therefore, you can indeed earn points for each die placed on the round track if it matches a die in your window. If you have multiple dice that match, this could potentially lead to multiple points for each die on the round track.

1 point for each die in the diagonal. Each die is counted only once, even if it is part of more than one line.

[solo-how-many-actions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1928333/solo-how-many-actions)

You may place a die and use a tool (with a different die) during your turn. So on a Round you could actually take all 4 dice - 2 to place in your window and 2 to use for tools.

> Can you use a lathekin to make a pattern you couldn’t have in normal placement?
> Say you have two sections of dice connected by a 3: you have dice 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the first row, and dice 6, 7, a blank spot, 8, and 9 in the second row. 
> With the lathekin, can you move die 3 somewhere else, so that now dice 1, 2, 6, and 7 are disconnected from dice 4, 5, 8, and 9?

Yes, you can!

Using the Lathekin Tool allows you to create a pattern that would not be possible through normal placement rules. The Lathekin permits you to move two dice, which can break connections between dice that would normally need to be adjacent.

In your example, moving die 3 to a new location could indeed separate the groups (1, 2, 6, and 7 from 4, 5, 8, and 9). The move is valid as long as it still respects other placement rules, such as color and number restrictions on the target spaces. The Lathekin tool essentially bypasses the standard adjacency requirement temporarily, allowing for more flexible reconfiguration.

> In solo mode, can you place a die on a tool card even if it is not possible to perform the tool action, or if you simply don't want to perform the tool action?

You can't place a die unless you actually use that tool. 
However, there is one particular tool that you can essentially 'not use' by taking it as literally as the rest - Tap Wheel. As it says "Move UP TO two dice", you could move zero dice as that is fewer than two!

> Who gets to decide which die is to be placed on the round number space? The start player of the the just finished round? Someone else? Also, it is not explicitly stated, but is the die to be placed on the round track supposed to show the side up that was rolled, or does the player who places it there get to decide? The example in the rules shows a purple 5 remaining a 5 on the round one space.

If there's more than one die left over, only one die is used to cover the round space. The rest just sit on the board. If for example, there are 2 dice left over in round one, you wouldn't cover both the 1 and 2 spaces on the round tracker, just the 1 space.

> When using the Passion expansion and the Rare Glass Dice, do you count the Rare Glass Dice more than once because they're wild?

Rare Glass die isn't a "wild color". It's a new color that can be placed in any color restriction, but count as another color. So in this case you would score only 6 points (2 for top green dice, 2 for low green dice, 2 for left red dice).

Could someone break this down for me and point out the column numbers and row letters for the dice being scored in this example?

Here are the column numbers and row letters:
4G 1G 6G 4G 4G
2R 3R 3R
5Y 2Y 3Y
6P 5P 6P
1B 4B 2B

Each row is the set of dice of a certain color. There are three columns that have all 5 colors. So that means you have three sets of 1 of each color.
The simple way to score it is to count how many you have of each color and take the least one. That is how many full sets you have.

[explanation-tool-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1944649/explanation-tool-cards)

> The questions are about the tool cards following cards:
Eglomise brush - Do you have to make the move exactly as described (two cells above and three to the right) with the number described (the red 3) or is there room for interpretation (which I think it is). Could it be with any number, to every place as long as there are no same numbers or colors next to each other and as long as the moved die connects to another (earlier) placed die.
Tap wheel and Lathekin - Also the move question as I had with eglomise brush
Copper foil burnisher - Also move question? What is that with the white 1 on the card?
Running pliers - What means skip your next turn this round? Why would I use this tool?

Move according to the written instructions in the rulebook:

The white 1 is an example of a value restriction, i.e. that space has to have a 1 on it. The tool allows you to ignore that.

The "skip your next turn" bit is because you're taking your 2nd die before you should do so (jumping the queue), so when the turn order comes back around to you for the 2nd die you don't take it because you already have.

> Question regarding Eglomise brush. When no other move is possible, is it also allowed to move? For example a green to green value because the die number suits better?

Sure! The card allows you to ignore color restrictions, but if you don't need to then no problem.

[flux-brush-tool-no-6-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2611695/flux-brush-tool-no-6-question)

> If I use the Flux Brush to re-roll a die and get a legally playable number, but don't want to place it. Can I leave it in the pool? I know I can pass ordinarily, but if already committed to a draft I don't know if that changes things. Does it? In this case I needed one specific number to complete a goal and didn't get it, so it forced me to miss the goal if placed.

According to the rulebook, when using the Flux Brush Tool, once you draft and re-roll a die, you must place it if it has a legally playable number. The rule states: 

"After drafting, re-roll the drafted die. If it cannot be placed, return it to the Draft Pool."

This tool says that if you cannot place the die then you return it to draft pool. So if you can place it, well, you have to place it.
In your turn you have the option to draft, use a tool or do nothing. But if you choose one of them you have to complete that action if it's have a legal placement.
And if you don't want to place one die to not miss an objective you will have a hole in your window at the end of the game. You will lose 1 point for any holes and won't complete any objectives that consider row or column for that empty space.

In this way, don't we have lesser chances to use tools cards? Do we have to use 4 or 5 tools cards in a 4 players match?

After the first use, any subsequent use costs 2. The only difference of having more players is that maybe you get fewer chances of being the first to use a card. Really it just puts a bit more pressure on using them earlier so you get the one token cost advantage, but usually using them earlier is not as good as using them later, so that's the trade-off. Always remember that by not using them, you get to count your unused tokens as points at the end of the game, so it's not a waste if you can't take an action and are left with tokens.

[public-objective-scoring](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1762575/public-objective-scoring)

> We played our first game today and had a question rewarding the scoring of public Objective cards. If the same die could be counted twice due to it making two sets of the public Objective, is it counted twice, or only once.
For instance, if the public Objective is "Light Shades" (2vp for each set of 1 value and 2 value dice). If I have a set of 1 with a 2 in the same column, and another set of 1 and 2 in a row, but I would be using the same value 2 card to make the sets, do I only score one set, or both since I'm reusing one of the dice to make them?

It doesn't matter if the dice are in rows or columns. The "set" would include, in your example, a 1 pip die, and a two pip die as the set, giving you 2vp. Those dice cannot be counted toward another "set". That is, each die can only belong to one set.
The scoring example in the rule book should help clarify as well.

[copper-foil-burnisher-ruling-dispute](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2371080/copper-foil-burnisher-ruling-dispute)

The question revolve around Copper Foil burnisher ruling dispute, so can you move a die to a tile that doesn’t have a value restriction

The Copper Foil Burnished states:
"Move anyone die in your window ignoring value restrictions you must obey all other placement restrictions."
The tool allows you to ignore the restrictions given on your window card. So, you could place a 2 over a 3 (or a 2 over a blank), but not next to another 2. There are no mechanics in the game that allow you to ignore adjacency restrictions of color and value.

In the rulebook its clarifies that: When taking a Rare Glass die, do you skip drafting a die that turn?
A: (Updated: Sept 22/20) Up to you, if you play the "Publisher's Variant" then taking a Rare Glass die is done in place of a regular "Draft a Die" action. If you play the "Designer's Variant", the Rare Glass die is considered a variant to a Tool (hence why it replaces one Tool card) and does not prevent you from your regular "Draft a Die" action.

This means you should only draft a die if you can place it on your window. Alternatively, you may pass. If none of the dice can be legally placed, you are forced to pass your turn.

Drafting and placing is atomic. This tool allows another step to be added to the atomic action of "draft and place"... it's now "draft, swap and place". In short, you can't use the tool unless you can perform the modified, atomic action ending with a valid placement.

The rulebook does not specify which tool cards are easier for beginners, but it does indicate that you can choose the number of tool cards based on difficulty, where having more tools (up to 5) makes the game easier and fewer tools (down to 1) makes it more challenging. For beginners, it’s best to choose tools that don’t require complex manipulation of dice that are already placed on the window. Here are some good choices:

1. The Tool that lets you flip a die to the other side (where opposite sides always add up to 7).
2. The Tool that allows you to swap a die from the round tracker with one from the dice pool.
3. The Tool that lets you grab a new die from the bag and set its value.

Additionally, the +/- 1 Tool is also great for first-time players.

> Now, in the game set-up, it says to place all 90 dice in the dice bag to start, which we have done. However, I have received the 5-6 player expansion today and the rule book for that states that for standard rules set-up, to place a differing amount of dice in the bag to start dependant on the number of players.I understand that they needed to up the number for playing with five or six people, but for two for example, it says that we should only be playing with 10 dice of each colour, so a total of 50, not 90 as stated in the original game. I just wanted to check, is this therefore an amendment to the original rules and something that technically we should be adopting now?

Yes, the starting rules from the 5-6 player expansion replaces the base game rules even with games less than 5 players. They change this to "fix" randomness of dice colors in games with less than 4 players. That way you can know how many dice of that color still have to show later in game. I see it like a variant to spice up things.

[tool-cards-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1937449/tool-cards-questions)

Can the "after drafting" power be used on a die from a previous round? Can a die be drafted but not placed so that a tool card can be used before its placement?

When it says "after drafting" the actions are performed on the die that you just drafted. The tool's ability does not carry on to the next time you draft. The tool and draft actions may be performed in any order. For example, you may pay to use a tool and move a die and then draft and place a die, or you may draft and place a die and then use a tool to move a die.

[public-objectives-explanations](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2121000/public-objectives-explanations)

> Struggling with interpreting the various public objective cards and how to score them. For example, the various shade cards give points for pairs of numbers. Are these pairs adjacent or do they have a space between them? As the card is read per its illustration with a gap between the two dice, when compared to say the Color Variety card which also has a gap between the dice, it implies that there must be a gap. But that also seems odd, so we are unsure. If they are to be adjacent, why not illustrate them touching on the card? Another example is that Color Variety card. Does the set need to be in that W arrangement, or does it mean any set of each of the five colors regardless of orientation?

If you're trying to count sets of 1s and 2s, for example, count up your 1s, count up your 2s, whichever there are fewer of is how many sets you have. If you're trying to count sets of all colors, just count up each color separately; whichever color you have the fewest of, you have that many sets of all colors. Where they are placed on your window when you count them, in relation to each other or otherwise, does not matter at all. You do not count all possible permutations. if you have two 1s and two 2s, you do NOT count the first 1 and the first 2, the first 1 and the second 2, the second 1 and the first 2, and the second 1 and the second 2 separately. two 1s and two 2s is 2 sets of 1-2. two 1s and four 2s is still 2 sets of 1-2.

That you don't need to count actual sets, just the number of dice for given type. You will always have sets equal to the fewest number of dice of the types contained in the set. So example, If you have 5 red, 5 blue, 5 yellow, 5 purple, 2 green dice <- Number of Sets, because the 2 green dice are the fewest quantity of that type. It's the same with shades.

Can I move red, blue and yellow dice because those 3 colors are there? Or for example only yellow, because it was the last color on the round board?

The Tap Wheel tool says: Move up to two dice of the same color that match the color of a die on the Round Track. Because it says "a die", it means you can use the color of any die on the Round Board. So in your example, you could move up to 2 red dice, up to 2 blue dice, or up to 2 yellow dice.

Draft means to take a dice from the die pool. So you draft once, place it, use the tool, and draft again. Super helpful if you really need two dice and can’t take the chance that someone will gobble one up.

In the last round of a 4 player game there are no dice left in the bag. And the tool clearly says after drafting a die, return it to the bag, take a Die from the bag and choose a number. So basically the die you are taking out of the bag is the same die you are putting in the bag. So basically it turns into “Draft a die and then change its number to whatever you want”. So if there’s not the colour you want in the draft it’s no use, but as long as there’s a colour you can use the number doesn’t matter.

It's two points for each pair of 3-4 (set of two different numbers). So in your example, it's two points. We always tell players to count how many they have of each of the two numbers, and multiply the lower total by two. With 5x3s and 1x4, you have 2 points. A 3 and a 4 (anywhere on your board) is a set. Each set is worth 2 points. Each die can only count toward a single set per objective card.

The key word here is anywhere. Forget rows, columns, pull all dice off the board if you want. It is just about the colors of the dice.

No, you cannot intentionally place a die illegally. The rules say you must follow the given restrictions or obey the dice placement rules. Unintentional illegal dice placement happens, which is why we call out how to resolve it in the rulebook. The rules about correcting illegal placements are outlined on page 4 in the "Dice Placement Mistakes" section:

“If a Player’s Window is ever found to break any of the placement restrictions, that player must immediately remove dice (of their choice) from their Window until all restrictions are obeyed. These dice are out of play and any resulting open spaces will count against their score as normal.”

The intention of the rules is such that players would never be able to break them. If you're knowingly/intentionally breaking a rule to exploit the resolution, that would be considered cheating.

That means that I only can re-arrange a die without taking a second one from the ones I just rolled? That means That I only can draft one die this round and my window will not be complete at the end of the game.

No, using Tool 2 does not prevent you from drafting a new die. In each round, you have two turns, and during each turn, you can either draft a die, use a tool, or both. According to the rulebook, the actions you can take on your turn are outlined in the "Gameplay" section on page 3:

“On a player’s turn, they may perform each of the following actions in any order:

 - **Select 1 die** from the Draft Pool and place it in an open space on their Window. This is referred to as Drafting a Die.
 - **Use 1 Tool Card** by spending Favor Tokens.

*Each action is optional — A player may choose to perform both actions, only one action, or pass their turn taking no actions.*”

So, you can indeed draft a die and use a tool (such as Tool 2 to rearrange dice you’ve already placed) in the same round. You are allowed to place up to two dice in your window during a round, either by drafting and placing one die per turn or combining actions as needed.

Yes, there can be a scenario where no dice are on the edge after moving them. In the rulebook, the relevant rule about die placement can be found on page 3 under the "Dice Placement Restrictions" section which states that:

**“First die: Each player’s first die of the game must be placed on an edge or corner space.”**

There is no requirement that "at least one die has to be on an edge at all times." After the first die placement, other dice can be moved, and it is allowed for none of the dice to remain on an edge. This is within the rules, though it may seem thematically unusual.

For the Deep Shades public objective, you score 2 points for each "Set" of 5 and 6 values anywhere on your board. To determine a set, you count all the 5s and 6s you have. The number of sets is determined by the color you have in the fewest quantity. For example, if you have four 6s and three 5s, you will have 3 sets (one set for each 5 and 6) and score 6 points. Any extra dice that don't form a set (like an unpaired 6) don't contribute.

It refers to the color or shade printed on your player board. There isn't an ability (yet...) that lets you break the color or shade restriction of being orthogonally adjacent. So, you could place a red die on a blue restriction, but not if it's next to another red die.

I said it was legal as the ‘following all placement rules’ apply to where you are placing the die after drafting or moving, and not the state of the window. But after looking through the rules section I can’t find clarification of this. So can I be educated on this?

If the die moved from column 4 was placed before (so die in column 5 was touching it diagonally), there's no problem in left one die alone. What you cannot do is place a die not touching (orthogonal or diagonally) another one already in your player board (there's a tool that allow that but you have to pay for that).

> If you use a tool's powers to place a die where it cannot normally be placed, what is the best way to mark or remember this? If you don't remember it, you may "catch" it later in the game, and have to take the penalty for an illegally placed die. Especially if players use that tool more than once. How confusing this is. Any detailed clarifications?

For a certain, adjacency rules can never be broken. It's only the colours or dots underneath the dice that can be broken.

Just identification numbers.
