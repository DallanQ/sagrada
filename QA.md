> In solo mode, you're trying to beat the total of the dice on the round card. But each round, unless you use a tool, you'll be putting two dice on the card. Does this mean you're going to be totaling 15-19 dice (depending on how many tools you use)?

Yes. Your challenge is to choose dice that is both good for you and low for round track each round, and using tools for reduce total dice in round track too.

> The game has a tool card that says "Move any one die in your window ignoring color restrictions" with a picture of a red die placed in a blue space." my question is: can we use this card for place a die adjacent to a die of the same color too?

The tool Card is intended to be used so you can cover a colour on your board with a different coloured die. However, it also states that you can never break the adjacency rules. Never.

> In solo mode what does the Running Pliers tool card mean? What is my first turn?

Your "first turn" is the first die that you draft in a round. The Running Pliers allow you to take both of your dice consecutively with no other players choosing in between.

> In solo mode what does that Tap Wheel tool card mean? How do you pick the color of the die on the round track? Are you able to pick any color on the round track?

Whatever color that you like on the round track, so long as you have two dice of that color in your window that can be legally swapped.

> When playing solo are you allowed to take 2 turns and also use a tool card or is it 1 turn and 1 tool.

It's actually up to two tools and up to two dice, divided into two sections. On your first turn of the round, you may take one die, and you may use one tool - both are optional, not mandatory. Then, on your second turn, you may do the same again. The Running Pliers would be an exception to this as you only take one turn in the round - you take one die (optional, although why you would not is unclear) and then you use a tool (the Pliers) to take another die. You do not get another turn that round so you could not use another tool.

> When playing solo are there any times you will not add any dice to the round track?

No, because the turn track is the timer for the end of the game.

> When you draft and place the second die, can you also play a second tool if you wanted to?

Basically you get to draft both your dice for the round right away. This could be helpful, for instance, towards the end of the game when you are running out of placements on your player board, and two dice come up that you can use, and you don't want other players to snatch up the second one before your second draft that round.
You draft your first die, use the tool to draft your second die, then everyone else goes. When it gets back to you that round you do nothing, since you have already drafted both dice that round.

> The rules state that the first dice must be placed on an edge or a corner. Does this mean that the middle three slots on the top/bottom rows cannot be initial dice placement spots? In other words, are the "roof" and "floor" of the future window are not considered edges?

There are 4 edges to the window, any of them are valid for the first die placed. There's no distinction between side-edges or top/bottom edges.

The corners are mentioned to help clarify that they are valid (since playtesting revealed a few questions about corners specifically).

> This question is in regard to the last die, or any undrafted dice. Besides keeping track of the round number, is there anything productive you can use those dice for?

Yes, there's a tool that lets you exchange you drafted die with one of the unchosen ones, pretty handy towards the end when you are the last player and you are left with no useful options top choose from.

But in the solo mode, you add the pips from all the dice on the round marker board to set the target score you're trying to beat each game, so you also have to think carefully about which dice you're NOT choosing each round.

[a-couple-of-specific-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2189133/a-couple-of-specific-questions)

> Tool Card #11 Flux Remover: When you pull a die from the bag, is it a random color or chosen color? Also, must the die be placed in the same window slot as the die you originally drafted?

When using Flux remover, you don't place the die at all, you just put it in the bag and take one out. You don't get to choose the color of the new die - you're stuck with whatever it is.
So pulling a die doesn't mean you get to choose the die. Drafting a die only means selecting from the pool, so there is no "same slot" to put it in.

> Public Objective - Color Diagonals: Are the dice counted in pairs or collectively? And can you count a die again if it's diagonal to multiple dice? For example, the picture on the card shows 4 blue dice, and 3 yellow dice. Would that be 3, 5, or 8 points? Or, if I had a X shape, would that be 1, 4, or 5 points?

You count every die that is diagonally adjacent to another of the same color collectively, so you would get 4+3=7 points for the configuration shown on the card. An X shape would be 5 points.
And if a die is adjacent diagonally to any other same colored die, count it as 1 point, otherwise, zero points. You can have a maximum of 20, because each die counts only once.

[problem-with-placing-dices](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3020005/problem-with-placing-dices)

> Concerning placing dice, for example when there are 2 players, often only one dice would be left at the end of the turn - so it goes on the round track. But what if there are two left? Should the dice placed on the track be chosen randomly? Because there are two tools that are connected to those dices. One that allows you to move dice of the same colour as the one on the track (which one of multiple left from last round should count?) and the other which lets you take any dice from the track.

From page 4 of the rulebook: It state that "all remaining dice are placed on the Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces."
Normally, you should only have one die left after everyone has taken their turn regardless of the player count. The only reason you would have more is that, if a player, for any or some reason was unable to place a die/dice. As noted above, all remaining dice go onto the round track. Just put the extra(s) above or below the normal one for the round. For the purpose of tools, all of the dice on the round track would count.

> How about the solo variant? Will all unused dices from each turn counts to the points you have to beat? (Which means at least 20 various dice?) - Is it even possible to win?

From page 4 of the rulebook: It state that "all remaining dice are placed on the Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces."
All of the unplayed dice count. And if player have been unable to play an additional 10 dice then the player will likely lose.
And yes, player have to play against at least 20 dice. As sometimes it can be brutal.

[round-track-match](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2718459/round-track-match)

> Two players were in a situation where both of them could not draft in the second draft round. In other words, there were three dice in the drafting pool where we were not able to draft at all. So while paying attention not to cover extra rounds, we would normally move all these three dice to the round track. We had the public mission "Round Track Match," which gives three points for each dice in your window that matches those on the round track. As the first player, should I be the one who chooses which of the remaining die should be placed on the round spot, while my partner argued I could not as it would be another form of drafting in a situation where I cannot draft.
Rulebook explains the procedure as follows: All remaining dice are placed on Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces.
As seen above, there is no explicit statement whether the first player of the round chooses the die that covers the spot of the just-completed round. So we were wondering what the official solution for this case is.

All unused dice cover the same spot. Nothing in the rules suggests you choose only one die to go on the round track.

1 point for each die in the diagonal. Each die is counted only once, even if it is part of more than one line.

[solo-how-many-actions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1928333/solo-how-many-actions)

You may place a die and use a tool (with a different die) during your turn. So on a Round you could actually take all 4 dice - 2 to place in your window and 2 to use for tools.

You can't place a die unless you actually use that tool. 
However, there is one particular tool that you can essentially 'not use' by taking it as literally as the rest - Tap Wheel. As it says "Move UP TO two dice", you could move zero dice as that is fewer than two!

> Who gets to decide which die is to be placed on the round number space? The start player of the the just finished round? Someone else? Also, it is not explicitly stated, but is the die to be placed on the round track supposed to show the side up that was rolled, or does the player who places it there get to decide? The example in the rules shows a purple 5 remaining a 5 on the round one space.

If there's more than one die left over, only one die is used to cover the round space. The rest just sit on the board. If for example, there are 2 dice left over in round one, you wouldn't cover both the 1 and 2 spaces on the round tracker, just the 1 space.

Rare Glass die isn't a "wild color". It's a new color that can be placed in any color restriction, but count as another color. So in this case you would score only 6 points (2 for top green dice, 2 for low green dice, 2 for left red dice).

[color-variety-card-and-rules-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3102671/color-variety-card-and-rules-clarification)

> I need some clarification on how Color Variety card works and what the card text and rules example is trying to convey. Because the card says, Color Variety - Sets of one of each color anywhere. Could someone break this down for me and point out the column numbers and row letters for the dice being scored in this example?

Here are the column numbers and row letters:
4G 1G 6G 4G 4G
2R 3R 3R
5Y 2Y 3Y
6P 5P 6P
1B 4B 2B

Each row is the set of dice of a certain color. There are three columns that have all 5 colors. So that means you have three sets of 1 of each color.
The simple way to score it is to count how many you have of each color and take the least one. That is how many full sets you have.

[explanation-tool-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1944649/explanation-tool-cards)

> The questions are about the tool cards following cards:
Eglomise brush - Do you have to make the move exactly as described (two cells above and three to the right) with the number described (the red 3) or is there room for interpretation (which I think it is). Could it be with any number, to every place as long as there are no same numbers or colors next to each other and as long as the moved die connects to another (earlier) placed die.
Tap wheel and Lathekin - Also the move question as I had with eglomise brush
Copper foil burnisher - Also move question? What is that with the white 1 on the card?
Running pliers - What means skip your next turn this round? Why would I use this tool?

Move according to the written instructions in the rulebook:

The white 1 is an example of a value restriction, i.e. that space has to have a 1 on it. The tool allows you to ignore that.

The "skip your next turn" bit is because you're taking your 2nd die before you should do so (jumping the queue), so when the turn order comes back around to you for the 2nd die you don't take it because you already have.

> Question regarding Eglomise brush. When no other move is possible, is it also allowed to move? For example a green to geen value because the die number suits better?

Sure! The card allows you to ignore color restrictions, but if you don't need to then no problem.

I know I can pass ordinarily, but if already committed to a draft I don't know if that changes things. Does it? In this case I needed one specific number to complete a goal and didn't get it, so it forced me to miss the goal if placed.

In the rulebook, Flux Brush Tool
state: After drafting, re-roll the drafted die. If it cannot be placed, return it to the Draft Pool.
This tool says that if you cannot place the die then you return it to draft pool. So if you can place it, well, you have to place it.
In your turn you have the option to draft, use a tool or do nothing. But if you choose one of them you have to complete that action if it's have a legal placement.
And if you don't want to place one die to not miss an objective you will have a hole in your window at the end of the game. You will lose 1 point for any holes and won't complete any objectives that consider row or column for that empty space.

Yes, you can place any die next to any other die diagonally, but you can't have 2 dice that are the same color or pip count orthogonally. In another word, you can place next to any previously placed die (as long as you don't break the adjacency, color or number restrictions, of course)

But what happens during a 4 players game? 3 cards? Or more? Because being double players we have the same amount of tokens each one, but the spaces occupied in the cards are doubled.
In this way, don't we have lesser chances to use tools cards? Do we have to use 4 or 5 tools cards in a 4 players match?

After the first use, any subsequent use costs 2. The only difference of having more players is that maybe you get fewer chances of being the first to use a card. Really it just puts a bit more pressure on using them earlier so you get the one token cost advantage, but usually using them earlier is not as good as using them later, so that's the trade-off. Always remember that by not using them, you get to count your unused tokens as points at the end of the game, so it's not a waste if you can't take an action and are left with tokens.

For instance, if the public Objective is "Light Shades" (2vp for each set of 1 value and 2 value dice). If I have a set of 1 with a 2 in the same column, and another set of 1 and 2 in a row, but I would be using the same value 2 card to make the sets, do I only score one set, or both since I'm reusing one of the dice to make them?

It doesn't matter if the dice are in rows or columns. The "set" would include, in your example, a 1 pip die, and a two pip die as the set, giving you 2vp. Those dice cannot be counted toward another "set". That is, each die can only belong to one set.
The scoring example in the rule book should help clarify as well.

The question revolve around Copper Foil burnisher ruling dispute, so can you move a die to a tile that doesn’t have a value restriction

The Copper Foil Burnished states:
"Move anyone die in your window ignoring value restrictions you must obey all other placement restrictions."
The tool allows you to ignore the restrictions given on your window card. So, you could place a 2 over a 3 (or a 2 over a blank), but not next to another 2. There are no mechanics in the game that allow you to ignore adjacency restrictions of color and value.

A: (Updated: Sept 22/20) Up to you, if you play the "Publisher's Variant" then taking a Rare Glass die is done in place of a regular "Draft a Die" action. If you play the "Designer's Variant", the Rare Glass die is considered a variant to a Tool (hence why it replaces one Tool card) and does not prevent you from your regular "Draft a Die" action.

[tool-3-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2449951/tool-3-clarification)

> Interpretation for Tool 3. Do you avoid constraints based on the number on the card/pattern or do you also ignore the dice around the dice you are moving? In that example drawn on the card (tool number 3) could the yellow dice be a 3?

You only ignore the requirement printed on the window card.
As far as I know, none of the tool cards allow you to place same colours or same numbers next to each other.

[setup-check-for-both-expansions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2856372/setup-check-for-both-expansions)

> Just want to check I've got the setup right when using Passion & Life.
In the centre would be:
- Round track
- 2 tool cards
- 3 public objectives (base game + symmetry (Passion) + toil (life))
- the dice pool
- 1 rare glass board (Passion)
- apprentice deck
- masterwork board & dice
Each player would have:
- favour tokens based on the difficulty of their window
- 1 inspiration card (Passion)
- 1 private objective (base game + rare dice (passion))
- apprentice window pattern
Does that sound about right?
I was wondering if it would be better to lay out 3 public objectives; 1 base game, 1 from Life, 1 from Passion?
You could do the same with the private as well, give everyone 1 from the base game and 1 from Passion.
Any thoughts?

All public objectives could be randomly selected, so you don't need to choose one from each expansion. But this way you guarantee some great replayability each time you play.
Just be sure to not have objectives that conflict with others.
And about private objetives: the way you described is a "variant". Official rules states players get only 1 Passion private objective (if playing with Rare Glass module).
I called a "variant" because it's what the FAQ we have here said (and I liked, sounds like a "new module").
1 private objective (the Rare Glass from Passion) is the publisher's way (written in rules). 2 private objective (Rare Glass + base game, or even from 5-6 PE) it's the designer's way. That's what I meant.
But in reality is just up to us to decide the way we'll play. And that's what I love the most in those Sagrada expansions!

> Does Game Setup have to happen after Player Setup? I understand that the digital app does it this way, but is it explicitly stated that one has to happen before the other?

Intentionally done to prevent new players from thinking they needed to make considerations like that (the decision should be based purely on difficulty level). There's no reason once you're experienced you can't perform player setup after game setup, though

[can-a-player-draft-a-dice-to-just-discard-it](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1766512/can-a-player-draft-a-dice-to-just-discard-it)

> Can a player only draft a dice that can be legally placed? If none of the dice can be legally placed, and the tools cannot assist a player, is the player forced to pass his/her turn?

On your turn you may draft any die you want. You can then either use it in your window or discard it. If the tools don't help then you can draft a die that your neighbor wants (if you like to play viciously).
EDIT: It seems that this is one thing that changed in the final copy of the rules: "Players may choose not to draft a die during their turn."
So if you want to play with the official rules, you should only draft a die if you can place it on your window. Alternatively, you may pass.

[error-while-placing-dice](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1850309/error-while-placing-dice)

> If you see you did an error when you placed the dice and didn't respect a rule, can you remove the dice as soon as you see it or must you wait until the end of the game? I'm not implying you redraft if you see the mistake, but that could help you save some points if you can replace the bad dice later (even if 1 spot will be left open at the end for sure).

Siting the rulebook, Page 4: It Quote:
If a Player’s Window is ever found to break any of the placement restrictions, that player must immediately remove dice (of their choice) from their Window until all restrictions are obeyed.

[lens-cutter-5-tool-card-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1866493/lens-cutter-5-tool-card-clarification)

> When using the Lens Cutter(5)Tool Card I assume the dice drafted by the player does not have to valid for placement, but the dice chosen from the Round Track has to be? When playing this card started a discussion if a player could draft dice that could not be placed on their window?
While, The card reads "After drafting, swap the drafted die with a die from the Round Track."

Drafting and placing is atomic. This tool allows another step to be added to the atomic action of "draft and place"... it's now "draft, swap and place". In short, you can't use the tool unless you can perform the modified, atomic action ending with a valid placement.

[color-diagonals-public-objective](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1763317/color-diagonals-public-objective)

> Would Color Diagonals score only the longest color run? Or potentially score for each color?
And. . .in the example shown on the card, would the blue score as 3 points or 4 points (can the diagonal run change direction)?

Every dice that is diagonally adjacent to a dice of the same color is worth 1 point.
