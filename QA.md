[question-about-scoring-for-solo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2874409/question-about-scoring-for-solo)
> In solo mode, you're trying to beat the total of the dice on the round card. But each round, unless you use a tool, you'll be putting two dice on the card. Does this mean you're going to be totaling 15-19 dice (depending on how many tools you use)?

Yes. Your challenge is to choose dice that is both good for you and low for round track each round, and using tools for reduce total dice in round track too.

> The game has a tool card that says "Move any one die in your window ignoring color restrictions" with a picture of a red die placed in a blue space." my question is: can we use this card for place a die adjacent to a die of the same color too?

The tool Card is intended to be used so you can cover a colour on your board with a different coloured die. However, it also states that you can never break the adjacency rules. Never.
  
[running-pliers-and-tap-wheel-explained-plz](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2867007/running-pliers-and-tap-wheel-explained-plz)

> In solo mode what does the Running Pliers tool card mean? What is my first turn?

Your "first turn" is the first die that you draft in a round. The Running Pliers allow you to take both of your dice consecutively with no other players choosing in between.

> In solo mode what does that Tap Wheel tool card mean? How do you pick the color of the die on the round track? Are you able to pick any color on the round track?

Whatever color that you like on the round track, so long as you have two dice of that color in your window that can be legally swapped.

> When playing solo are you allowed to take 2 turns and also use a tool card or is it 1 turn and 1 tool.

It's actually up to two tools and up to two dice, divided into two sections. On your first turn of the round, you may take one die, and you may use one tool - both are optional, not mandatory. Then, on your second turn, you may do the same again. The Running Pliers would be an exception to this as you only take one turn in the round - you take one die (optional, although why you would not is unclear) and then you use a tool (the Pliers) to take another die. You do not get another turn that round so you could not use another tool.

> When playing solo are there any times you will not add any dice to the round track?

No, because the turn track is the timer for the end of the game.
  
[question-about-running-pliers](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2089185/question-about-running-pliers)

> The Running Pliers card reads After your first turn, immediately draft a die. Skip your next turn this round." It sound like you get to draft a place a second die right away, but lose your next turn.
> When you draft and place the second die, can you also play a second tool if you wanted to?

Basically you get to draft both your dice for the round right away. This could be helpful, for instance, towards the end of the game when you are running out of placements on your player board, and two dice come up that you can use, and you don't want other players to snatch up the second one before your second draft that round.
You draft your first die, use the tool to draft your second die, then everyone else goes. When it gets back to you that round you do nothing, since you have already drafted both dice that round.

[initial-dice-placement-are-the-topsbottoms-also-ed](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1765937/initial-dice-placement-are-the-topsbottoms-also-ed)

> The rules state that the first dice must be placed on an edge or a corner. Does this mean that the middle three slots on the top/bottom rows cannot be initial dice placement spots? In other words, are the "roof" and "floor" of the future window are not considered edges?

There are 4 edges to the window, any of them are valid for the first die placed. There's no distinction between side-edges or top/bottom edges.

The corners are mentioned to help clarify that they are valid (since playtesting revealed a few questions about corners specifically).

[rule-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2086608/rule-clarification)

> This question is in regard to the last die, or any undrafted dice. Besides keeping track of the round number, is there anything productive you can use those dice for?

Yes, there's a tool that lets you exchange you drafted die with one of the unchosen ones, pretty handy towards the end when you are the last player and you are left with no useful options top choose from.

But in the solo mode, you add the pips from all the dice on the round marker board to set the target score you're trying to beat each game, so you also have to think carefully about which dice you're NOT choosing each round.

> In solo mode you get two Private Objectives face up and you get to score one of them. Don't you also still get one Private Objective face down that you score?

In Solo mode section from rulebook: End game scoring - Tally your Victory Point total as normal (selecting only one of the
two Private Objectives), however, you lose 3 Victory Points for
each open space.

It says about only two private objectives. You don't get a face down like a multiplayer game. This is one of the small changes from normal setup.

> Is there an advantage to choosing a more difficult tile? If you use up all your tokens, do you get more points for doing the harder tile?

No. Each favor token is worth a point at the end of the game, so if you don’t end up spending any, you will get points. But the card itself doesn’t give you any points.

Yes, that's the correct order.
From the rulebook: "Once the last player has completed their first turn, the round continues in reverse order (counter-clockwise). Beginning with the last player, each player takes a second turn."

[a-couple-of-specific-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2189133/a-couple-of-specific-questions)

> Tool Card #11 Flux Remover: When you pull a die from the bag, is it a random color or chosen color? Also, must the die be placed in the same window slot as the die you originally drafted?

When using Flux remover, you don't place the die at all, you just put it in the bag and take one out. You don't get to choose the color of the new die - you're stuck with whatever it is.
So pulling a die doesn't mean you get to choose the die. Drafting a die only means selecting from the pool, so there is no "same slot" to put it in.

> Public Objective - Color Diagonals: Are the dice counted in pairs or collectively? And can you count a die again if it's diagonal to multiple dice? For example, the picture on the card shows 4 blue dice, and 3 yellow dice. Would that be 3, 5, or 8 points? Or, if I had a X shape, would that be 1, 4, or 5 points?

You count every die that is diagonally adjacent to another of the same color collectively, so you would get 4+3=7 points for the configuration shown on the card. An X shape would be 5 points.
And if a die is adjacent diagonally to any other same colored die, count it as 1 point, otherwise, zero points. You can have a maximum of 20, because each die counts only once.

[problem-with-placing-dices](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3020005/problem-with-placing-dices)

> Concerning placing dice, for example when there are 2 players, often only one dice would be left at the end of the turn - so it goes on the round track. But what if there are two left? Should the dice placed on the track be chosen randomly? Because there are two tools that are connected to those dices. One that allows you to move dice of the same colour as the one on the track (which one of multiple left from last round should count?) and the other which lets you take any dice from the track.

From page 4 of the rulebook: It state that "all remaining dice are placed on the Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces."
Normally, you should only have one die left after everyone has taken their turn regardless of the player count. The only reason you would have more is that, if a player, for any or some reason was unable to place a die/dice. As noted above, all remaining dice go onto the round track. Just put the extra(s) above or below the normal one for the round. For the purpose of tools, all of the dice on the round track would count.

> How about the solo variant? Will all unused dices from each turn counts to the points you have to beat? (Which means at least 20 various dice?) - Is it even possible to win?

From page 4 of the rulebook: It state that "all remaining dice are placed on the Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces."
All of the unplayed dice count. And if player have been unable to play an additional 10 dice then the player will likely lose.
And yes, player have to play against at least 20 dice. As sometimes it can be brutal.

[round-track-match](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2718459/round-track-match)

> Two players were in a situation where both of them could not draft in the second draft round. In other words, there were three dice in the drafting pool where we were not able to draft at all. So while paying attention not to cover extra rounds, we would normally move all these three dice to the round track. We had the public mission "Round Track Match," which gives three points for each dice in your window that matches those on the round track. As the first player, should I be the one who chooses which of the remaining die should be placed on the round spot, while my partner argued I could not as it would be another form of drafting in a situation where I cannot draft.
Rulebook explains the procedure as follows: All remaining dice are placed on Round Track, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces.
As seen above, there is no explicit statement whether the first player of the round chooses the die that covers the spot of the just-completed round. So we were wondering what the official solution for this case is.

All unused dice cover the same spot. Nothing in the rules suggests you choose only one die to go on the round track.

[sagrada-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2692672/sagrada-clarification)

> How do you score public objective card, color diagonals? Is it 1 point for each diagonal, or 1 point for each square in the diagonal? Also, if it is 1 point for each square, is it counted twice if the diagonals go in different directions? Would the point value of the card in the deck be 3,8, or 7?

1 point for each die in the diagonal. Each die is counted only once, even if it is part of more than one line.

[solo-how-many-actions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1928333/solo-how-many-actions)

> My question is related to the turns in solo mode: how many actions can you have? The rule book says: "Take 2 turns, choosing to Draft and Place a die (as normal) and/or use a Tool Card, or pass. At the end of the Round, remaining dice are placed on the Round Track."
> Does this mean that in the turn I can:
> Place a dice and use a tool?
> Place a dice only and no tool usage?
> Use a tool only and no dice placing?
> or pass?
> And then, in my second turn, do once again as mentioned above?

You may place a die and use a tool (with a different die) during your turn. So on a Round you could actually take all 4 dice - 2 to place in your window and 2 to use for tools.

[solo-tool-use-or-not](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1869688/solo-tool-use-or-not)

> In solo mode, can you place a die on a tool card even if it is not possible to perform the tool action, or if you simply don't want to perform the tool action?

You can't place a die unless you actually use that tool. 
However, there is one particular tool that you can essentially 'not use' by taking it as literally as the rest - Tap Wheel. As it says "Move UP TO two dice", you could move zero dice as that is fewer than two!

[unused-dice](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1762064/unused-dice)

> About unused dice, when a round is over, you place one die on the round marker track. What do you do with any other dice left over? Do they go back in the bag or are they discarded from the game?

You place all remaining dice on the round track, but only cover 1 space. All dice on the round track are available for the tools that reference them

> who gets to decide which die is to be placed on the round number space? The start player of the the just finished round? Someone else? Also, it is not explicitly stated, but is the die to be placed on the round track supposed to show the side up that was rolled, or does the player who places it there get to decide? The example in the rules shows a purple 5 remaining a 5 on the round one space.

If there's more than one die left over, only one die is used to cover the round space. The rest just sit on the board. If for example, there are 2 dice left over in round one, you wouldn't cover both the 1 and 2 spaces on the round tracker, just the 1 space.
